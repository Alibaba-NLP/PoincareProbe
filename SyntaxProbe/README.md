# Syntax Probe

## Dataset

Follow [Structure Probe](https://github.com/john-hewitt/structural-probes) to obtain `ptb3-wsj-train/dev/test.conllx` and put them into `./data`. Then generate the datasets using `data.py`.

## Syntax Visualization

Dataset needs to be generated first to visualize the syntax subspaces, since it is needed to know the root and ground truth word pairs.

## Run Experiment

Run experiments using `run.py` or `run.sh`.
